The peer reviews are graded together, out of 10 points

[10]. Excellent. One or more insightful comments, in an otherwise careful pair of reviews. The grader will make preliminary notes on each project before reading the peer reviews---one way to secure an excellent review grade is to write a report that is useful to the grader for extending, clarifying, or correcting their review notes.

[9]. Careful reviews, correctly identifying several strengths and weaknesses.

[8]. Thoughtful comments, but with limitations. Perhaps inadequate attention was paid to technical detail. Less commonly, too much attention is given to technical detail at the expense of a broader view.

[7]. Satisfactory, but superficial. Missing multiple issues.

[0-6]. Work not carried out to Masters level.
