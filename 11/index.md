We are borrowing material from a short course on [Simulation-Based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics](https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/) (SBIED).
This short course uses the same notation as DATASCI/STATS 531 and shares an emphasis on likelihood methods for inference.
Indeed, SBIED can be viewed as a sub-course within DATASCI/STATS 531.
Although SBIED focuses on epidemiological examples, you can check from previous final projects for [2016](http://ionides.github.io/531w16/final_project/), [2018](http://ionides.github.io/531w18/final_project/), [2020](http://ionides.github.io/531w20/final_project/), [2021](http://ionides.github.io/531w21/final_project/), [2022](http://ionides.github.io/531w22/final_project/) that the ideas extend readily to a variety of other situations.
Later, in Chapter 16, we will consider models for financial markets, which is another major area of application for nonlinear time series techniques. 

Chapter 11 Part 2 has overlap with Chapter 10. It may be no bad thing to see the foundational material again, from a slightly different perspective. You are welcome to watch at 1.5 x speed if you are already comfortable with Chapter 10.
